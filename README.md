To see the project you need Expo app on your phone.

easyChat is my first project on React Native. It took me almost 2 weeks to learn everything from scratch.

My goal was having a nickname-pick input that re-routes to main chat window, just like in the old mirc days.

I used firebase db to hold an array of objects that hold ids, messages and senders data.

Overall it was fun, and there are tons to learn, it's very exciting.
